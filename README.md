**Grassroots Intelligence For Technological Sustainability (GIFTS)**

We explore repurposing discarded smartphones for energy management in buildings. We hope to 
address both environmental concerns of electronic waste and the need for building automation. 

Due to resource constraints, we will update this repository on a rolling basis. 
The next update is expected on 30th April, 2024

## A brief thinking process
The idea popped up like many others when we were all stuck at home. 
We spent more time observing the everyday surroundings and deviated from normal routines to explore "strange" things. 
Tough times, but solidarity and caring were not in short supply. 
Many times, we wanted to help as individuals, but we weren't quite sure where to start.
Combining these with our professional backgrounds, the idea naturally emerged.

This repo is not about proving any technological or scientific breakthroughs. 
Quite the contrary, we want to demonstrate what we can achieve 
with modern tools, DIY mindset and the willingness of contributing to solving problems we created. 
Most importantly, we also want to have some fun. 

## What's the plan?
We are figuring out the best plan given resource limits.
